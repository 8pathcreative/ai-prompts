# Portfolio Prompt Design Cheat-Sheet

Prompt engineering creates language that is easier for an A.I. to understand what we want and what we don’t want. Here are examples of prompts you can use to explore prompt engineering for your portfolio.

### Principles of Good Prompt Crafting

1. Your outputs are only as good as what you put in (shit in = shit out).
2. You can get close but you will need to edit and refine what comes out.
3. Start small, be specific and experiment.

## Prompts Ingredients

<aside>
💡 Use these prompts to experiment and create your own content.

</aside>

### 1. Objective Prompts

<aside>
📕 The more specific you are the better answers or responses you will get. Define what your looking for, what you don’t want and what good looks like.

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 Create 8 project titles for a designer case study. I will send a message with context around the case study. You will wait until my next message then send me an outline only of a case study using that context.

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 I just completed a project as a designer at ACME inc. Your aim is to turn that project into a case study for my portfolio. I want you to ask me one question at a time about the project. Only ask 8 questions total. Then after all 8 questions have been answered send my responses back to me in the form of a design case study.

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 **Your aim is to** craft impactful titles for a website case study. The case study is for a junior designers portfolio. **it should focus** on why the project is important, what problem it solves and how it helps people. **it should not mention** any parts of the design process. **I[t](http://process.It) should mention** the user **at least once in the title**. I will send you a description of the project. **After I send** “DONE”, **you will then send me** 10 options for titles.

</aside>

### 2. Set Identity Prompts

<aside>
📕 You can roleplay with chatGPT to simulate advice, interviews and conversations with different kinds of people. Define roles, experiences and specialisation then ask questions and guide roleplay.

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 You are a professional design researcher. You have been running market research projects with large teams to understand language gamification for over 10 years. You specialise in large population research for the mobile market.

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 **You are a** recruiter for a software development company **that focusses on** sustainable technology. **You have been tasked with** hiring a user experience design.

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 **You are a** career adviser. **You have been** helping young professional women (aged 50-70) on navigating career changes to find their dream job for the past 20 years.

</aside>

### 3. Give **Context and Data in Multiple Messages**

<aside>
📕 Sometimes you want to feed extra information or send it in short bursts. It’s best to keep instructions to only feeding in data and waiting until you tell it your done. Be aware, chat GPT can only remember the last 3000 words of the current conversation.

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 Context: “ {insert context here}”

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 I’m going to send information about the context, don’t do anything or reply until I say: DONE. Then wait for my next message.

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 I will send multiple messages with context around a case study project that I have completed as a designer. You will wait until a message says “DONE” then you will send me 8 title ideas. Confirm you understand by saying yes. Then only respond with “waiting for the next message”until you receive “DONE” as a message.

</aside>

### 4. Constraint Output and Being Specific.

<aside>
📕 Use these sentences to constrain and set direction.

</aside>

<aside>
🤖 Do not _____

I want you to replace _____ with more ____, keep _______.

</aside>

### 4. Writing styles and Formatting
